As part of my Master's Degree, I wrote a paper on optimal geometric structures
for points in motion. The paper was accepted to 
[CCCG 2023](https://cccg.ca/)
and completed under the supervision of [Prof. Subhash Suri](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/).

I presented this work in person at CCCG 2023. You can view my slides 
[with Animations (recommended)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MKy7tYt9qB_dtnc0FJGKTIhlZRmUTyvqwTy5HnqwICY/edit#slide=id.p)
or [as a PDF](/static/moving-points-cccg.pdf).

You can also view the full paper in the 
[CCCG 2023 Proceedings](https://wadscccg2023.encs.concordia.ca/assets/pdf/CCCG_2023_proc.pdf).
